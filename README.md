# YOLO for ROS with Kinect
This package provides an ROS interface to run the YOLO in the ROS as a node that subscribe camera topic,and you can choose to use webcam or Kinect to perform Real-Time Object Detection.The defaoult camera is Kinect.If you want to use another camera,you need to change the subscribed topic name in the yolo_ros.cpp. 
Besides,the package hasn't contains any pretrained convolutional weights,you need to download on the website and default uses the tiny-yolo-voc.weights.Of course,you can use your trained convolutional weights but don't forget to match the object labol in yolo_ros.cpp.

This package has been tested in Ubuntu 14.04 with camera of Kinect and webcam.

##Preparation
If you have installed the usb_cam package,Kinect_ros package and CUDA,you can ignore this part.

1.usb_cam:
`cd ~/catkin_ws/src`
`git clone https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam.git`
`cd ~/catkin_ws`
`catkin_make`
You can test the webcam after installed the package.
`roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam.launch`

2.Kinect_ros:
`sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-* ros-indigo-openni2-* ros-indigo-freenect-*`
`rospack profile`
You can test the camera after installed the package.
`roscore`
`roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch`
show RGB image:
`rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color`
show Depth image:
`rosrun image_view disparity_view image:=/camera/depth/disparity`

3.CUDA 8.0
To install CUDA has a long progress,I recommand to follow the official tutorial.The tutorial weill tell you how to do in detail but need more patient to follow it.

##Installation
Git clone the package into your catkin workspace.
`cd catkin_ws/src`
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Jiajie-Ye/darknet_ros.git`

Then,you need to download the weights file on the website.

`cd catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/weights/`
`wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights`
`wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/tiny-yolo-voc.weights`

And then,often the yolo_ros.cpp file and modify the workspace name.(default workspace name:catkin_ws)

`char *cfg = "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/cfg/tiny-yolo-voc.cfg";`
`char *weights = "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/weights/tiny-yolo-voc.weights";`

Last,compile the package.
`cd ../`
`catkin_make`

##RUN
Run the yolo_ros node and camera.
`roslaunch darknet_ros yolo_kinect_ros.launch`

## Use other trained weights files: 
Firstly,you need to provide the weights and cfg files into the directories:

`catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/weights/`
`catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/cfg/`

Then,often the yolo_ros.cpp file and modify the current path of the weights and cfg files you have trained.

`char *cfg = "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/cfg/yolo.cfg";`
`char *weights = "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/weights/yolo.weights";`

Compile with catkin_make and run it.

## Use other camera: 
In order to use other camer,you need to modify the camera topic name and the launch file.
for example,I want to use the webcam,modify the name just like the following lines ①②③：

`const std::string CAMERA_TOPIC_NAME = "/camera/rgb/image_raw";//1`
`const std::string CAMERA_WIDTH_PARAM ="/yolo_ros/image_width";//2`
`const std::string CAMERA_HEIGHT_PARAM ="/yolo_ros/image_height";//3`
`//const std::string CAMERA_TOPIC_NAME = "/usb_cam/image_raw";//①`
`//const std::string CAMERA_WIDTH_PARAM = "/usb_cam/image_width";//②`
`//const std::string CAMERA_HEIGHT_PARAM = "/usb_cam/image_height";//③`

Then,run the following command:

`roslaunch darknet_ros yolo_webcam_ros.launch`

##Issues
Q1:When catkin_make the package it shows a warning like that `warning:deprecated conversion from string constant to ‘char*’` ,and it also can compile successfully,but it won't run after run the launch file.
A1:modify the define of cfg and weights as the followings:

`char *cfg =(char*) "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/cfg/yolo.cfg";`
`char *weights =(char*) "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/darknet_ros/weights/yolo.weights";`

Compile with catkin_make and run it.
